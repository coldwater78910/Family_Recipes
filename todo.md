# Recipe Website — Todo

Last updated: 11 November 2025

This file lists design tasks, feature work, infra items and the current status. I've reorganized and cleaned the list so the top sections contain active work / next steps and the bottom records completed items and notes.

## Active work (high priority)

## Recent changes

<!-- Recent changes recorded; completed markers removed for brevity. -->

## Notes

- Several legacy pages still contain inline recipe arrays; those should be consolidated to `recipes-data.js` when convenient.
- The server and ngrok setup are intentionally minimal and for local/private use only; do not expose the helper publicly without additional locking.

## Next actions
